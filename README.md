# CryptoClustering
Module_19_Challenge_Unsupervised_Learning

### For this assingment I am working on a project to explore patterns in cryptocurrency prices, looking specifically at how they change over 24 hours and 7 days.

I started by loading the data, scaling it so everythingâ€™s on the same level, and then used the elbow method to figure out the ideal number of groups (or clusters) for these cryptocurrencies. 
Once I had a good cluster number, I used K-means clustering to actually group them and then visualize these groups to see if there are any interesting patterns in the short and medium term price changes.
After that, I tried simplifying the data by reducing it to three main features using PCA. I repeated the clustering steps to see if this simplified version gives similar or different results. 
By the end, I had a good sense of whether fewer features can still reveal meaningful patterns, or if more detail is necessary to capture how these cryptocurrencies behave.
